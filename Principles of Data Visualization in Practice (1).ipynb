    "## OVERVIEW DATA VISUALIZATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is a form of interpreting information by combining images such as charts, and graphs, with text. It has gained popularity across the scientific literature which helps with useful insights into data. This is beneficial to quickly and effectively convey information\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the purpose of visualization is to convey answers to concrete questions (like the distribution of values in a dataset or what is the maximum, minimum, or outlier values in a dataset) about a given problem and facts about a given problem we were not aware of. This is imperative as we will be able to extract an accurate understanding and interpretation of data.\n"

Next, we calculate the interquartile range (IQR) – the difference between the third and first quartiles. Now, we can calculate minimum and maximum values. Minimum is Q1 – 1.5 * IQR and maximum is Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. All data points falling outside the range of minimum and maximum are outliers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some technical considerations when using colors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing color figures that work well in both color and black-and-white formats whenever possible. This ensures that information remains clear when converted to grayscale.\n",

    "### 5 - Include Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty is a vital aspect of understanding most systems. Failing to represent it in visuals can mislead. Two key challenges with visualizing uncertainty are not including it and misrepresenting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, figures omit uncertainty, leaving gaps in the statistical message, potentially raising doubts about other aspects like mean inference. Including uncertainty is usually straightforward using common features like error bars or shaded intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize uncertainty either implicitly within existing geometries (e.g., box plots) or explicitly as separate geometries (e.g., error bars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing uncertainty is challenging. Metrics like standard deviation, standard error, confidence intervals, and credible intervals convey different information. Choosing the right one is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressing uncertainty is essential, but so is interpreting it correctly. For instance, the mere presence of error bars doesn't guarantee significance; interpretation matters. Some even advise against using standard error due to its limitations. If possible, show the data, especially with small sample sizes, to avoid misinterpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is uncertainty an inherent part of understanding mostsystems, failure to include uncertainty in a visual can bemisleading. There exist two primary challenges with includinguncertainty in visuals: failure to include uncertainty and misrep-resentation (or misinterpretation) of uncertainty.Uncertainty is often not included in figures and, therefore, partof the statistical message is left out—possibly calling into ques-tion other parts of the statistical message, such as inference onthe mean. Including uncertainty is typically easy in most softwareprograms, and can take the form of common geometries such aserror bars and shaded intervals (polygons), among other fea-tures.15Another way to approach visualizing uncertainty iswhether it is included implicitly into the existing geometries,such as in a box plot (Figure 1E) or distribution (Figures 1B and1G), or whether it is included explicitly as an additional geometry,such as an error bar or shaded region (Figure 1D).Representing uncertainty is often a challenge.23Standard de-viation, standard error, confidence intervals, and credible inter-vals are all common metrics of uncertainty, but each representsa different measure. Expressing uncertainty requires thatreaders be familiar with metrics of uncertainty and their interpre-tation; however, it is also the responsibility of the figure author toadopt the most appropriate measure of uncertainty. Forinstance, standard deviation is based on the spread of thedata and therefore shares information about the entire popula-tion, including the range in which we might expect new values.On the other hand, standard error is a measure of the uncertaintyin the mean (or some other estimate) and is strongly influencedby  sample  size—namely,  standard  error  decreases  withincreasing sample size. Confidence intervals are primarily fordisplaying the reliability of a measurement. Credible intervals,almost exclusively associated with Bayesian methods, are typi-cally built off distributions and have probabilistic interpretations.Expressing uncertainty is important, but it is also important tointerpret the correct message. Krzywinski and Altman23directlyaddress a common misconception: ‘‘a gap between (error) barsdoes not ensure significance, nor does overlap rule it out—it de-pends on the type of bar.’’ This is a good reminder to be veryclear not only in stating what type of uncertainty you are sharing,but what the interpretation is. Others16even go so far as torecommend that standard error not be used because it doesnot provide clear information about standard errors of differ-ences among means. One recommendation to go along with ex-pressing uncertainty is, if possible, to show the data (seeUse anEffective Geometry and Show Data). Particularly when the sam-ple size is low, showing a reader where the data occur can helpavoid misinterpretations of uncertainty"

    "\n",
    "An effective visual technique is to use small multiples, which involves repeating a figure to emphasize differences. This approach, also known as paneling or faceting, aims to enhance comparisons by keeping design elements consistent across panels. Each panel typically represents a variation in one variable, such as time, groups, or factors, ensuring that data comparisons are clear and straightforward. The goal of small multiples is to make data naturally comparable, ensuring effective visual comparisons\n",

    "A particularly effective visual approach is to repeat a figure tohighlight differences. This approach is often called small multiples, and the technique may be referred to as paneling orfaceting (Figure 1G). The strategy behind small multiples is thatbecause many of the design elements are the same—forexample, the axes, axes scales, and geometry are often thesame—the differences in the data are easier to show. In otherwords, each panel represents a change in one variable, whichis commonly a time step, a group, or some other factor. Theobjective of small multiples is to make the data inevitably compa-rable,7and effective small multiples always accomplish thesecomparisons"

    "### 7 - Detailed captions\n",
    "\n",
    "While emphasizing high data-ink ratios is crucial, it's equally vital to provide comprehensive captions that thoroughly clarify the content within the figure. A study conducted on figures in the Journal of American Medicine revealed that over one-third of graphs lacked self-explanatory qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Captions should be self-sufficient. This means that if the figure and its caption were examined independently from the rest of the study, the primary message(s) should still be clear. While it's acknowledged that some statistical models and procedures may require more than just a caption for explanation, the fundamental principle remains that captions should make every effort to elucidate the visualization and representations utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, captions should elucidate any geometries employed. Even in a simple scatterplot, it should explicitly state that the black dots represent the data (Figures 1C–1E). Box plots also demand descriptions of their structure. While certain aspects of a box plot might be assumed, not all box plot symbols are universally understood.\n",

    "As important as it is to use high data-ink ratios, it is equallyimportant to have detailed captions that fully explain everythingin the figure.

Captions should be standalone, which means thatif the figure and caption were looked at independent from therest of the study, the major point(s) could still be understood.Obviously not all figures can be completely standalone, assome statistical models and other procedures require morethan a caption as explanation. However, the principle remainsthat captions should do all they can to explain the visualizationand representations used. Captions should explain any geome-tries used; for instance, even in a simple scatterplot it should bestated that the black dots represent the data (Figures 1C–1E).Box plots also require descriptions of their geometry—it mightbe assumed what the features of a box plot are, yet not all boxplot symbols are universal"
